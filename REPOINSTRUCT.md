# Parallel and Distributed Computing
This markdown file hopes to provide a general user with instructions on how to clone my repository for Parallel and Distributed Systems. The file will also use plain English to help users navigate easily to the directory of their choice.

# Repository Overview
The repository has to branches; namely; main and documentation. 

The main branch is the working tree for holding code i.e the implementation of assignments using multithreaded approach and libraries.

The documentation branch holds the reports(documentation) expected of each assignment and implementation generated.

## Cloning Repo
For a user to use this repository, I assume they have the basic knowledge and experience with using version control(git to be specific)

To clone the repository:
1. Navigate to an empty directory in your local system, where you want to clone the repository.
2. Open terminal from that location and run the command `git clone https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing.git `

## Navigating Branches
To switch between branches you can use the git checkout command. Remember `main` holds code and `documentation` holds reports and typesets.

To switch to main branch run the command: `git checkout main`

Main is the default branch.

To switch to switch to documentation branch run the command: `git checkout documentation`

Instead of the `checkout` command you can also use the `switch` command which is more intuitive

# Main Branch
The main branch is held at [Main](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing)
