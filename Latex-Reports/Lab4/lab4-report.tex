\section*{Introduction}
    This report was generated as a requirement of Lab 4 for Parallel and Distributing computing. The report contains two sections; Part 1 and Part 2. Part 1 is the Lab where I experiment with the MaoReduce framework and my understanding in class. Part 2 is the project which focuses on implementing matrix multiplication using MapReduce algorithms. 
\section*{Part 1}
    \subsection*{MapReduce Framework \& Why}
    My selected MapReduce framework was MrJob. I chose MrJob because of the following reasons:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item it provides an easy route for writing python programs that run on Apache Hadoop.
            \item it provides an easy switch for input and output formats with a single line of code.
            \item All codes are written in a single python class which enforces the understanding of OPP concepts.
            \item it has an extensive documentation with examples as reference, which, makes learning of the framework easy.
        \end{itemize}
    Installing MrJob was easy because it require running a command with the python pip package. However, understanding the documentation and how to submit my first job took some time to understand.

    \subsection*{Word-count Algorithm}
        The word count algorithm inherited the \textbf{MrJob}
