        Personal Computers were first available on the mass market in 
        1977.  At that time there were basically three brands widely 
        available, Apple, Tandy, and Commodore.  I bought a TRS-80 model 
        I in the fall of that year and began computer consulting the 
        next spring.  Things have changed a lot in the last 14 years.  
        These are a few observations on some of the developments and 
        trends.
        In the early 1980s a man would come to me and say, "I have a 
        problem in my business.  It concerns efficiency in office 
        procedures.  I am covered up in writing, bookkeeping, billing, 
        paying, keeping track of customers, etc.  They said you have 
        been able to show other businesses how to use computers to solve 
        these problems.  Please show me."
        I would then analyse his business talking not only to him but 
        primarily to his secretary and/or bookkeeper(s) to find just how 
        his business ran, what the problems were, and what was unique 
        about his business (something almost always was).  I would plan 
        hardware and develop software designed to work efficiently to 
        solve his problems and to grow with his business for the next 
        five or (wistfully) ten years.  I would install the system, 
        train his employees and support the system with further 
        modifications, hardware and software maintenance, additional 
        training, etc. as needed.  This worked well and was always 
        successful.
