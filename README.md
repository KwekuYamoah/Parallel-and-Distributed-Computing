## Lab 1 Code files
The code files for lab 1 is held in the folder as `Lab1/Codes`. Any user can download this folder and run the codes in their unix environment. To view the code files for lab 1 see: [Lab 1 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab1/Codes)

To read the report for lab 1 see: [Lab 1 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/e0dc0f747d5cdd237bd1aa82770f1b89f798f01e/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab1Report.pdf)

## Lab 2 Code Files
All code files for used for lab 2 assignment can be found in this folder: [Lab 2 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/bcc89d35cdfec830ffd62c2a2f5225424d8a17e3/README.md#L13). When you get to this folder you need to compile and run the C program `naive_ompMT.c` in your Linux environment using the gcc compiler. The C program can be found here: [naive_ompMT.c](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/bcc89d35cdfec830ffd62c2a2f5225424d8a17e3/Lab2/naive_ompMT.c#L1)
