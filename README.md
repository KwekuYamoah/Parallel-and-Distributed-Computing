# Parallel and Distributed Computing Assignment Documentation
This branch will hold the documentation for all assignments undertaken for Parallel and Distributed Computing course.

## Lab 1 Report
The report for lab 1 is titled as `KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab1Report`. The pdf document was typeset in Latex. The file contains answers to the exploration of the top 5 hpc machines in the world and top most hpc machine in Africa. 

Another section of the file explores how to run and build code in a unix environment. To view the contents of the document use this link: [Lab 1 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/e0dc0f747d5cdd237bd1aa82770f1b89f798f01e/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab1Report.pdf)

To view the code files that generated the output for the Part 2 of the lab see: [Lab 1 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab1/Codes)

## Lab 2 Report
The report for Lab2 is titled us `KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab2Report`. You can find the file at link: [Lab 2 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/88d71a2eb3701d7c36774cd4140bf21e36e2c614/README.md#L14)

The document was typeset using latex. The folder containing all the latex file is found at the link: [Lab2 Latex TypeSet](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/88d71a2eb3701d7c36774cd4140bf21e36e2c614/README.md#L12)

To view the code files that were implemented and run to generate the output log for the comparative table in the report visit: [Lab2 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab2)

When you get to the above link compile and run the file `naive_ompMT.c` in your Linux environment.
