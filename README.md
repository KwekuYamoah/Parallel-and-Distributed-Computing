## Reports
Reports done for assignment are hosted on the documentation branch. To see visit [Documentations](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/documentation)

## Lab 1 Code files
The code files for lab 1 is held in the folder as `Lab1/Codes`. Any user can download this folder and run the codes in their unix environment. To view the code files for lab 1 see: [Lab 1 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab1/Codes)

To read the report for lab 1 see: [Lab 1 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/e0dc0f747d5cdd237bd1aa82770f1b89f798f01e/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab1Report.pdf)

## Lab 2 Code Files
All code files for used for lab 2 assignment can be found in this folder: [Lab 2 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/bcc89d35cdfec830ffd62c2a2f5225424d8a17e3/README.md#L13). When you get to this folder you need to compile and run the C program `naive_ompMT.c` in your Linux environment using the gcc compiler. The C program can be found here: [naive_ompMT.c](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/bcc89d35cdfec830ffd62c2a2f5225424d8a17e3/Lab2/naive_ompMT.c#L1)

To read the read report for lab 2 in a bid to cement understanding of the general goal of the assignment you can do so at [Lab 2 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/documentation/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab2Report.pdf)

A more detailed instruction for the documentation of lab 2 can be read at [Lab 2 README](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/documentation/README.md)

## Lab 3 Code Files
All code files for used for lab 3 assignment can be found in this folder: [Lab 3 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab3). 

When you get to this folder you need to compile and run the C program `matrix_mult.c` in your Linux environment using the gcc compiler. The C program can be found here: [matrix_mult.c](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/Lab3/matrix_mult.c)

Reading the documentation report for this code is essential for a successful execution. Do so here: [Lab 3 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/documentation/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab3Report.pdf)

A more detailed instruction for the documentation of lab 3 can be read at [Lab 3 README](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/documentation#lab-3-report)

## Lab 4 Code Files
All code files for used for lab 3 assignment can be found in this folder: [Lab 4 Codes](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/tree/main/Lab4). 

When you get to this folder you need to  programs in `Part 1` and `Part 2` in your Linux environment . To run the code in `Part 1` do `python3 mrjob_wordcount.py <input.txt --stop-words=stop_words.txt`. Code is found at [mrjob_wordcount.py](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/Lab4/Part%201/mrjob_wordcount.py)

To run the code in `Part 2` do run 
[matrix_mults.py](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/Lab4/Part%202/matrix_mults.py) first with the command `python3 matrix_mults.py N`; `N= size of matrix`.After run
`python3 mrjob_matrixmult.py matrix.txt --P=n`. Code is found at [mrjob_matrixmult.py](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/main/Lab4/Part%202/mrjob_matrixmult.py)


Reading the documentation report for this code is essential for a successful execution. Do so here: [Lab 4 Report](https://github.com/KwekuYamoah/Parallel-and-Distributed-Computing/blob/documentation/KwekuYamoah(71712022)-Lab4Report.pdf)
